# OVERDRIVE CITY — design & tuning reference

Everything gameplay-related is a constant in [`src/config.js`](../src/config.js).
This document explains what the numbers mean and how the systems interlock.
All values below are the shipped defaults.

## World

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `TILE` | 8 m | one tile of the city grid |
| `N` | 96 | city is N×N tiles → **768 × 768 m** |
| `SEED` | 20260717 | city-generation seed — same seed, same city |
| `DAY_LENGTH` | 480 s | one full day/night cycle |

The generator lays 2-tile-wide roads on jittered lines (5–8 tile gaps), marks
every road-adjacent tile as sidewalk, and fills each block interior with
buildings via recursive binary splits (downtown splits finer, max 4-tile
footprints → slender towers). Districts are assigned by distance from the map
center: **downtown** (towers, 18–58 m + 1.6× landmarks), **midtown** (10–26 m),
**residential** (5–12 m, 22% of footprints become yards), **industrial**
(southeast corner, wide 6–11 m sheds, 25% parking lots), plus a central
**park** and three random park blocks.

One `Uint8Array` tile map backs four systems:

1. **Collision** — circle-vs-tile with slide response (`collideCircle`)
2. **Line of sight** — DDA ray over tiles, buildings block (`hasLOS`)
3. **Lanes** — every road tile stores a direction code; right-hand traffic
   (southbound lane on the west column, eastbound on the south row)
4. **Placement** — samplable tile lists for missions, spawns, parking

## Drive model

Per fixed step (1/60 s), a vehicle's world velocity is decomposed into
forward `vF` and lateral `vL` components relative to its heading:

```
vF += throttle · accel · (1 − 0.55·vF/maxF) · dt      // tapered acceleration
vF −= vF · drag · dt                                   // 0.55 (×3.2 off-road)
heading += steer · steerRate · clamp(vF/9, −1, 1) · dt // speed-scaled steering
vL *= exp(−grip · dt)                                  // lateral grip
```

**The handbrake simply swaps `grip` (5.2–7.4 by car) for `1.4`.** That one
substitution is the entire drift system: lateral speed stops decaying, the
rear steps out, and body roll + skid marks + drift score all key off `|vL|`.

| Car | maxF (m/s) | accel | grip | steer | HP |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sedan | 26 | 9 | 6.2 | 2.1 | 100 |
| hatch | 23 | 10 | 6.8 | 2.4 | 85 |
| sports | 37 | 15 | 7.4 | 2.5 | 90 |
| pickup | 24 | 8 | 5.6 | 1.8 | 130 |
| van | 22 | 7 | 5.2 | 1.7 | 140 |
| taxi | 27 | 10 | 6.4 | 2.2 | 100 |
| police | 32 | 13 | 7.0 | 2.3 | 120 |

Wall impacts above 3 m/s of closing speed deal `2.2×` damage and spark;
car-vs-car deals `(closing − 4) × 2.0` (×0.35 when neither car is the
player's — AI fender-benders must not cascade into explosion chains).
At 0 HP a car detonates: 42-particle burst, 65 damage at the epicenter
falling off over 6 m, then a blackened husk.

## Wanted system

Crimes add **heat** (0–100). Every 20 heat = one star, five stars max.

| Crime | Heat |
|---|---|
| gunshot fired in public | +2 |
| punch landed | +3 |
| carjacking an occupied car | +8 |
| civilian downed | +13 |
| officer downed | +22 |
| wrecking a car (as player) | +10 (+22 police) |
| heavy wall slam / car hit | +1 – +3 |

Gain is capped at **40 heat/second** so a rampage escalates over seconds, not
frames. Decay only begins after **4 s outside every cop's line of sight**
(70 m foot / 90 m cruiser, tile-DDA checked) and runs at
`[2.2, 1.8, 1.5, 1.2, 1.0]` heat/s for 1★–5★ — higher stars stick longer.

Response budget by stars: foot officers `[2,3,4,4,5]`, cruisers `[0,1,2,3,4]`.
Below 3★ cruisers pull up near you and drop an officer; from 3★ they **ram**
at full throttle. Standing still (or stopped in a car) for **1.6 s** with an
officer within 3.4 m and eye contact = **BUSTED** (−20% cash). Death = −30%
cash. Surviving at 3★+ pays **$100 per 30 s** — chaos is a valid career.

When heat returns to zero all units stand down and leave; wrecks remain.

## Weapons

| Weapon | Damage | Interval | Range | Spread | Auto |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fists | 12 | 0.42 s | 1.9 m | — | no |
| Pistol | 26 | 0.34 s | 60 m | 0.012 rad | no |
| SMG | 11 | 0.085 s | 45 m | 0.045 rad | yes |

Hitscan: one ray from the camera through the crosshair, sphere tests against
every ped (r 0.55) and vehicle (r ≈ 1.5), clamped by a wall-distance probe on
the tile map. Tracers are pooled `Line` objects that fade in 90 ms.

**Tone rule:** civilians only flee (dust poof, tumble, fade — no gore);
everything that shoots back — cops, gang members, bodyguards — is armed.
There are no missions that target civilians.

## Missions

Ten archetypes, all generated from the same primitives: a random point /
target vehicle / target NPC, a timer, heat, and a reward scaled by distance,
stars and night (×1.2). Crime payouts **bank on evade** — they sit as pending
cash and pay out when heat hits zero.

| Archetype | Objective | Reward sketch | Banked? |
|---|---|---|---|
| COURIER | timed delivery | 70 + 0.5/m | no |
| RUSH HOUR | 3–5 drops, any order | 65/drop + 0.35/m | no |
| GYPSY CAB | fare across town, stop to drop | (60 + 0.4/m) × tip(time) | no |
| GHOST RUN | deliver at 0★ (soft-fail per star) | (110 + 0.45/m) × [2 / 1 / 0.5] | no |
| BOOST | steal marked car, deliver clean | (240 + 0.3/m) × condition% | yes |
| GETAWAY | spawn at 2–4★, evade, reach safehouse | 150 · stars^1.5 + 0.2/m | no |
| STREET CIRCUIT | 6–9 checkpoints vs par | 0.4/m × medal (2.2/1.5/1.0) | no |
| SIDEWAYS | drift score in a 34 m zone, 60 s | 180 × score/target (≤2.5×) | no |
| TURF HOLDOUT | 3–4 goon waves, stay in zone | 140/wave + 32/goon | yes |
| BOUNTY | guarded target | 300 + 70/guard | yes |

Circuit checkpoints are a random walk over the intersection graph; par time =
`pathLen/13 + 1.3·K` seconds, gold at 85% of par. Drift score accrues
`|vL| · speed · 0.45 · combo` per second inside the zone; the combo (≤3×)
resets 2 s after the last drift or on any collision.

## Day/night

Time-of-day lerps through 9 keyframes (midnight → dawn → noon → golden hour →
dusk → night) driving sky, fog color/distance, sun color/intensity and
hemisphere fill. The `nightFactor` ramp toggles: 900 pre-placed emissive
window quads, lamp heads, every awake vehicle's head/tail lights, and two real
spotlights on the player's car. The sun (one shadow-casting directional
light) orbits the player with a 140 m shadow box so shadows stay crisp
anywhere on the map.

## Performance budget

- Static city ≈ **10 draw calls**: merged vertex-colored ground, one
  `InstancedMesh` each for buildings, roofs, windows, lamp poles, lamp heads,
  trunks, canopies, lane dashes.
- Particles: one 600-slot `Points` cloud, CPU-simulated, preallocated.
- Tracers: 24 pooled lines. No allocation in the frame loop.
- Simulation is a fixed 60 Hz accumulator — physics identical at any refresh
  rate; rendering is uncapped.
- All spatial queries are O(1) tile lookups or short DDA walks. No physics
  engine, no navmesh, no pathfinding graph beyond the intersection list.
